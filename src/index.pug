              For my entire life, Iâ€™ve had a great love of music. I became proficient in voice, piano, and drums and ended up going to Berklee College of Music for Contemporary Writing and Production. I did all this in spite of the fact that I was born with a paralyzed left hand. One of the things I pursued was piano technology. I was one of many music lovers in a family of engineers, so I decided to combine the two worlds. There were plenty of people who told me that it would be impossible, but I decided to prove them wrong. After graduating from Berklee, I became a certified piano technician at Piano Technician Academy.
